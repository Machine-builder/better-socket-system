# better-socket-system
Introduces a better way of writing socket servers and clients. Good for LAN game development &amp; chat servers :)

# how do I use it?
Just take a look at the test_server and test_client files for an example of a basic echo server.
That's how you setup a super basic network that clients can connect to :)
