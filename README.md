# better-socket-system
Introduces a better way of writing socket servers and clients. Good for LAN game development &amp; chat servers :)

# how do I use it?
Just take a look at the test_server and test_client files for an example of a basic echo server.
That's how you setup a super basic network that clients can connect to :)

# credits
this whole system is by me, MACHINE_BUILDER
credit where credit is due, I used to use a very convoluted method of my own header system,
but thanks to Sentdex on YouTube (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8A4dqoGL62E), that's been improved a lot.

this is by no means perfect :P - just a personal project of mine. enjoy!
